# Spacial Reasoning Test Code (Group 13)

This repository contains code developed to run spatial reasoning tests written as part of the BIOS0030 course. 

In the spatial reasoning test, the spatial visualization ability of the test taker is strictly assessed. During the test, participants are presented with a series of blocks arranged in distinct geometric configurations. The test takers must identify the image that cannot be achieved by rotating the cube arrangement. Participants have unlimited attempts, but their total attempts are recorded. This count is used to calculate their correctness as a percentage, serving as an indicator of their spatial reasoning ability in this test. Additionally, the total time taken by participants is monitored to prevent bias. Results from those who take excessively long will be excluded. 

Libraries needed: IPython.display, time, request, BeautifulSoup from bs4, json, pandas and matplotlib.pyplot.
